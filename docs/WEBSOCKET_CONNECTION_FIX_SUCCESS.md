# 🎉 WebSocket Connection Fix - SUCCESS!

## ✅ **Issue Successfully Resolved**

### **🔍 Problem Identified:**
- **WebSocket Connection Error**: Error code 1006 (connection closed)
- **Root Cause**: Health check port mismatch causing service restarts
- **Impact**: Services were constantly restarting, preventing stable WebSocket connections

### **🔧 Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Orchestrator**: Running on port 8001, but health checks configured for port 8080
- **Media Server**: Running on port 8001, but health checks configured for port 8000
- **Result**: Services failed health checks → constant restarts → unstable connections

## 🔧 **Configuration Fixes Applied**

### **1. Orchestrator Deployment - FIXED ✅**
**Before:**
```yaml
ports:
  - containerPort: 8080  # Wrong port
  - containerPort: 8081  # Wrong port
livenessProbe:
  port: 8080  # Wrong port
readinessProbe:
  port: 8080  # Wrong port
```

**After:**
```yaml
ports:
  - containerPort: 8001  # Correct port
livenessProbe:
  port: 8001  # Correct port
readinessProbe:
  port: 8001  # Correct port
```

### **2. Media Server Deployment - FIXED ✅**
**Before:**
```yaml
ports:
  - containerPort: 8000  # Wrong port
livenessProbe:
  port: 8000  # Wrong port
readinessProbe:
  port: 8000  # Wrong port
```

**After:**
```yaml
ports:
  - containerPort: 8001  # Correct port
livenessProbe:
  port: 8001  # Correct port
readinessProbe:
  port: 8001  # Correct port
```
