# Session ID Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the logs and code analysis, several issues were found with session ID generation and management:

1. **Variable Name Conflicts**: In the orchestrator code, `sessionID` was used instead of the correct variable names (`mediaSessionID` and `frontendSessionID`)
2. **Inconsistent Session ID Formats**: Different components were generating session IDs in different formats
3. **Poor Session Mapping**: The mapping between media server session IDs and frontend session IDs was unreliable
4. **Missing Validation**: No validation of session ID formats

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Variable Name Conflicts in Orchestrator

**File**: `v2/orchestrator/main.go`

- Fixed all instances where `sessionID` was incorrectly used instead of `mediaSessionID` or `frontendSessionID`
- Updated logging statements to use correct variable names
- Fixed WebSocket message broadcasting to use `frontendSessionID` for client communication
- Fixed Kafka publishing to use `mediaSessionID` for internal processing

### 2. Improved Session ID Generation

**File**: `v2/media-server/internal/whip/handler.go`

- Enhanced session ID generation to include a random component
- Made format more consistent with frontend session IDs
- Improved uniqueness by using microsecond timestamps

### 3. Enhanced Session Mapping Logic

**File**: `v2/orchestrator/main.go`

- Improved `getFrontendSessionID()` function with better logging
- Added fallback logic to use media session ID as frontend session ID when no mapping exists
- Enhanced WebSocket handler to store session mappings more reliably
- Added reverse mapping for easier lookup

### 4. Added Session ID Validation

**File**: `v2/orchestrator/main.go`

- Added `isValidSessionID()` function to validate session ID format
- Implemented validation in `getOrCreateSession()` function
- Added warning logs for invalid session ID formats

### 5. Improved Logging and Debugging

- Added comprehensive logging for session creation and mapping
- Enhanced debug information for troubleshooting session issues
- Added session ID validation warnings

## Session ID Format

The system now uses a consistent session ID format:

```
session_{timestamp}_{random_part}
```

Where:
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp (microseconds for media server, milliseconds for frontend)
- `random_part`: Random string for uniqueness

### Examples:
- Media Server: `session_1753590741399040_5cc15fe6`
- Frontend: `session_1753590741399_qlgq6cfjw`

## Validation Rules

Session IDs are validated against these rules:
1. Minimum length of 20 characters
2. Must start with "session_"
3. Must have at least 3 parts separated by underscores
4. Second part (timestamp) must be numeric

## Testing

A test script (`test_session_id_fix.py`) was created to verify:
- Session ID generation works correctly
- Validation logic properly identifies valid/invalid IDs
- Both media server and frontend formats are supported

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Consistent Session Tracking**: Session IDs will be properly tracked throughout the pipeline
2. **Better Error Handling**: Invalid session IDs will be logged and handled gracefully
3. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging will help identify session-related issues
4. **Reliable Mapping**: Session mapping between components will be more reliable
5. **Reduced Errors**: The "undefined: sessionID" errors should be eliminated

## Files Modified

1. `v2/orchestrator/main.go` - Fixed variable names, improved session mapping, added validation
2. `v2/media-server/internal/whip/handler.go` - Enhanced session ID generation
3. `test_session_id_fix.py` - Created test script for validation
4. `SESSION_ID_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated orchestrator and media server
2. Monitor logs for session ID validation warnings
3. Verify that session tracking works correctly in production
4. Test the complete voice agent pipeline with the fixes
