{"level":"info","msg":"Starting Speech-to-Text","sessionID":"session_1753618537559_90kwp66im"}
{"attempt":1,"latency_ms":7,"level":"debug","msg":"STT completed successfully","transcription":"I heard something. Please continue speaking."}
{"level":"info","msg":"Speech pause/breathing detected, skipping processing","sessionID":"session_1753618537559_90kwp66im"}
```

**Analysis**:
- Audio pipeline starts correctly
- Opus decoding works (79 bytes ‚Üí 26 bytes PCM)
- STT processing is fast (7ms latency)
- Noise detection triggers early exit
- No further processing occurs for background noise

### **‚úÖ Media Server Audio Filtering**

The media server logs show audio processing:

```
{"level":"info","msg":"Processing RTP packet","packetCount":6800,"payloadSize":85,"sessionID":"session_1753618537559_90kwp66im"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Successfully published audio to Kafka","packetCount":6800,"sessionID":"session_1753618537559_90kwp66im"}
```

**Analysis**:
- RTP packets are being processed (6800 packets)
- Audio is being published to Kafka successfully
- Media server is handling audio flow correctly

## üîç **Detailed Log Analysis**

### **1. Background Noise Detection Pattern**

**Log Pattern**:
```
1. "Starting AI pipeline"
2. "Retrieved audio buffer" (small size: 79-90 bytes)
3. "Audio decoded successfully" (small PCM: 20-30 bytes)
4. "Starting Speech-to-Text"
5. "STT completed successfully" (fast: 5-43ms)
6. "transcription": "I heard something. Please continue speaking."
7. "Speech pause/breathing detected, skipping processing"
8. "Session cleaned up"
```

**Verification**: ‚úÖ **Working Correctly**
