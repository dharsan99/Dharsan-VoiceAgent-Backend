## 🔍 **Kafka Configuration - SUCCESS!**

### **✅ Media Server Kafka Connection:**
```
Media Server Kafka configuration - Host: redpanda.voice-agent-phase5.svc.cluster.local, Port: 9092, Address: redpanda.voice-agent-phase5.svc.cluster.local:9092
{"level":"info","msg":"Kafka service initialized","time":"2025-07-27T18:30:47.176Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Server starting on :8001","time":"2025-07-27T18:30:47.176Z"}
```

### **✅ Orchestrator Kafka Connection:**
```
{"level":"info","msg":"Starting WebSocket server","port":":8001","time":"2025-07-27T18:30:36Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Starting audio consumption...","time":"2025-07-27T18:30:36Z"}
```

**Note**: The "context deadline exceeded" errors are normal - the orchestrator is waiting for audio to be published to Kafka, which will happen when the frontend starts sending audio.
