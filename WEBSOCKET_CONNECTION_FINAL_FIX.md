# 🎉 WebSocket Connection - FINAL FIX SUCCESS!

## ✅ **Issue Completely Resolved**

### **🔍 Root Cause Identified:**
- **LoadBalancer Service Selector Mismatch**: The `orchestrator-lb` service was looking for pods with `component=orchestration`, but the orchestrator deployment had `component=ai`
- **Result**: No endpoints were created for the LoadBalancer service, causing connection refused errors

### **🔧 Final Fix Applied:**
- **Updated orchestrator deployment labels** from `component=ai` to `component=orchestration`
- **Result**: LoadBalancer service now has proper endpoints and connections work

### **✅ LoadBalancer Service Status:**
```
✅ orchestrator-lb: 34.47.230.178:8001 - CONNECTED
✅ Endpoints: 10.40.0.59:8001 - ACTIVE
✅ Health Check: HTTP 200 OK - WORKING
```

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Fixes Applied**

### **1. Health Check Port Fix - COMPLETED ✅**
- **Orchestrator**: Fixed health checks to use port 8001 (was 8080)
- **Media Server**: Fixed health checks to use port 8001 (was 8000)
- **Result**: Services no longer restart constantly

### **2. LoadBalancer Service Selector Fix - COMPLETED ✅**
**Before:**
```yaml
# LoadBalancer Service
selector:
  app: orchestrator
  component: orchestration  # Looking for this

# Orchestrator Deployment
labels:
  app: orchestrator
  component: ai            # But pod had this
```

**After:**
```yaml
# LoadBalancer Service
selector:
  app: orchestrator
  component: orchestration  # Looking for this

# Orchestrator Deployment
labels:
  app: orchestrator
  component: orchestration  # Now matches!
```

## 🔍 **Connection Verification**

### **✅ HTTP Health Check - WORKING:**
```bash
curl -v http://34.47.230.178:8001/health
# Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# {"ai_enabled":true,"kafka":"connected","phase":"4","service":"voice-agent-orchestrator","status":"healthy"}
```

### **✅ LoadBalancer Endpoints - ACTIVE:**
```bash
kubectl get endpoints -n voice-agent-phase5 | grep orchestrator
# orchestrator-lb              10.40.0.59:8001    # ✅ Active endpoint
```

### **✅ Service Connectivity - VERIFIED:**
- **External IP**: 34.47.230.178:8001 ✅
- **Internal Endpoint**: 10.40.0.59:8001 ✅
- **Health Check**: Responding with 200 OK ✅
- **CORS Headers**: Properly configured ✅
