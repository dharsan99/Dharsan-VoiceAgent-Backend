# WebSocket Connection Status Update

## ✅ **Major Progress Achieved**

### **WebSocket Connection Issues - RESOLVED**
- ✅ **Ping Message Format**: Fixed orchestrator to handle `{"type":"ping"}` format
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection**: Stable connections established
- ✅ **Greeting Flow**: `greeting_request` → `greeting` response working
- ✅ **Ping/Pong**: Heartbeat mechanism working without warnings
- ✅ **Auto-reconnection**: Frontend reconnection logic working

### **Deployment Status**
- ✅ **Orchestrator Updated**: New image with WebSocket fixes deployed
- ✅ **Frontend Updated**: Added pong event handling
- ✅ **Service Restart**: Orchestrator pod restarted successfully

## 🔍 **Current Status Analysis**

### **What's Working:**
1. ✅ **WebSocket Connection**: Stable connection to `ws://34.47.230.178:8001/ws`
2. ✅ **Greeting Flow**: Frontend receives greeting: "how may i help you today"
3. ✅ **Microphone Access**: Audio tracks captured successfully
4. ✅ **Audio Capture**: PCM audio being captured (8192 bytes)
5. ✅ **Audio Transmission**: Audio data sent to backend (106496 bytes)
6. ✅ **STT Processing**: Final transcript received: "Hello, Hi, how are you doing today?"
7. ✅ **Processing Start**: AI processing initiated successfully
8. ✅ **Ping/Pong**: Heartbeat mechanism working

### **What's Not Working:**
1. ❌ **Start Listening Event**: Frontend sends `start_listening` but orchestrator doesn't receive it
2. ❌ **Audio Processing**: "context deadline exceeded" errors in orchestrator
3. ❌ **AI Response**: No AI response generated due to audio processing failure
4. ❌ **TTS Audio**: No TTS audio received due to missing AI response

## 🛠️ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issue: Missing `start_listening` Event**
- **Symptom**: Frontend logs show `🎤 Sent start_listening event` but orchestrator logs show no `start_listening` events
- **Impact**: Audio processing pipeline cannot start without this event
- **Likely Cause**: Timing issue where event is sent before WebSocket connection is fully established

### **Secondary Issue: Audio Processing Pipeline**
- **Symptom**: "context deadline exceeded" errors when trying to consume audio
- **Impact**: No audio processing, no AI responses, no TTS
- **Root Cause**: Audio processing pipeline not properly initialized due to missing `start_listening` event

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Frontend Logs Analysis:**
```
✅ WebSocket connected
👋 Received greeting: how may i help you today
🎤 Sent start_listening event
🎤 Started capturing PCM audio...
🔄 Pipeline state update: listening
ℹ️ Info message: Started listening for audio input
🎤 Listening started for session: session_1753772387998_dsn0ls50n
✅ Final transcript: Hello, Hi, how are you doing today?
🔄 Processing started
📥 Received message: {event: 'pong', timestamp: '2025-07-29T07:00:18Z'}
❓ Unhandled event: pong  // FIXED: Added pong handling
```

### **Orchestrator Logs Analysis:**
```
✅ WebSocket client connected
✅ Raw WebSocket message received: {"event":"greeting_request","session_id":"..."}
✅ Sent greeting message
✅ Received ping message (type format)  // FIXED: No more warnings
❌ Failed to consume audio: context deadline exceeded
❌ No start_listening events received
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps Required**

### **Priority 1: Fix `start_listening` Event**
1. **Investigate Timing**: Check if `start_listening` event is sent too early
2. **Add Debug Logging**: Add more detailed logging in orchestrator for all WebSocket messages
3. **Verify Event Format**: Ensure event format matches orchestrator expectations
4. **Test Connection Stability**: Ensure WebSocket connection is stable when event is sent

### **Priority 2: Fix Audio Processing**
1. **Initialize Audio Pipeline**: Ensure audio processing pipeline starts correctly
2. **Fix Kafka Consumer**: Resolve "context deadline exceeded" errors
3. **Test Audio Flow**: Verify audio data flows from frontend to STT to AI to TTS

### **Priority 3: Complete End-to-End Testing**
1. **Full Conversation Test**: Test complete user input → AI response → TTS flow
2. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery
3. **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent users

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Current Progress:**
- **WebSocket Connection**: 100% ✅
- **Greeting Flow**: 100% ✅
- **Audio Capture**: 100% ✅
- **STT Processing**: 100% ✅
- **Start Listening Event**: 0% ❌
- **Audio Processing**: 0% ❌
- **AI Response**: 0% ❌
- **TTS Audio**: 0% ❌

### **Overall Progress: 50% Complete**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`orchestrator/main.go`**: Added ping message handling for `{"type":"ping"}` format
2. **`useVoiceAgentEventDriven.ts`**: Added pong event handling
3. **`WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION_FIX_SUCCESS.md`**: Documentation of fixes

### **Deployment Commands Used:**
```bash
# Build and push orchestrator image
cd orchestrator && docker build -t gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest --platform linux/amd64 .
docker push gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest

# Restart orchestrator deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/orchestrator -n voice-agent-phase5
kubectl rollout status deployment/orchestrator -n voice-agent-phase5 --timeout=300s
```

## 🎉 **Conclusion**

The WebSocket connection issues have been successfully resolved. The system now has:
- ✅ Stable WebSocket connections
- ✅ Working ping/pong heartbeat
- ✅ Successful greeting flow
- ✅ Audio capture and transmission
- ✅ STT processing

The remaining issue is the `start_listening` event not reaching the orchestrator, which is preventing the audio processing pipeline from starting. Once this is fixed, the complete voice agent pipeline should work end-to-end.
