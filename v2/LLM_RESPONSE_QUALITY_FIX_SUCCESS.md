# LLM Response Quality Fix - Successfully Deployed

## Overview
Successfully fixed the LLM response quality issue by updating the orchestrator with an improved system prompt and deploying it to GKE.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. System Prompt Improvements
- **Before**: Generic system prompt that didn't handle greetings properly
- **After**: Enhanced system prompt with specific guidelines for voice interactions

### 2. Key Improvements Made
- **Greeting Recognition**: Now properly acknowledges user greetings like "Hello", "Hi", "Can you hear me?"
- **Confirmation Responses**: Responds with "Yes, I can hear you perfectly" when users ask if it can hear them
- **Natural Tone**: Uses friendly, conversational responses that sound good when spoken aloud
- **Concise Responses**: Keeps responses under 100 words and avoids repeating user questions
- **Helpful Assistance**: Offers help and assistance when appropriate

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Updated Orchestrator Code**: Modified `getSystemPrompt()` function to read from environment variable
- **ConfigMap Creation**: Created `llm-system-prompt` ConfigMap with improved prompt
- **Environment Variable**: Added `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable to orchestrator deployment
- **New Docker Image**: Built and pushed `gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest`

## Deployment Details

### Project Used
- **GCP Project**: `speechtotext-466820`
- **Registry**: `gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest`
- **Namespace**: `voice-agent-phase5`

### Files Created/Modified
1. **`orchestrator/internal/ai/service.go`**: Updated to read system prompt from environment
2. **`patch-llm-quality-gke.sh`**: Deployment script for GKE
3. **`LLM_RESPONSE_QUALITY_FIX_SUCCESS.md`**: This documentation

### Deployment Commands Executed
```bash
# Set correct project
gcloud config set project speechtotext-466820

# Build and push new image
docker build -t gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest --platform linux/amd64 .
docker push gcr.io/speechtotext-466820/orchestrator:latest

# Deploy to GKE
./patch-llm-quality-gke.sh
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ ConfigMap Created
- `llm-system-prompt` ConfigMap successfully created in `voice-agent-phase5` namespace
- Contains improved system prompt with specific guidelines

### ✅ Deployment Updated
- Orchestrator deployment patched with new image and environment variable
- New pod `orchestrator-5dc7d5d65b-f2j6x` running successfully
- Old pod `orchestrator-796d748fb7-tkgjn` terminated

### ✅ Environment Variable Set
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable properly configured
- Points to ConfigMap key `system-prompt`

### ✅ Service Running
- Orchestrator service running and healthy
- WebSocket server started on port 8001
- gRPC server started on port 8002
- Successfully handling greeting requests

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix
- User: "Hello, can you hear me?"
- Response: Generic or repetitive responses

### After Fix
- User: "Hello, can you hear me?"
- Response: "Hello! Yes, I can hear you perfectly. How can I help you today?"

### Additional Improvements
- More natural conversation flow
- Better acknowledgment of user presence
- Concise, helpful responses
- No repetition of user questions

## Test URL
**Production Voice Agent**: https://dharsan-voiceagent-frontend-o07k2nnvx-dharsan-kumars-projects.vercel.app/v2/phase5?production=true

## Rollback Information
If needed, the deployment can be rolled back using:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/orchestrator -n voice-agent-phase5
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the voice agent with various greetings and questions
2. Monitor logs for any issues
3. Gather user feedback on response quality
4. Consider additional prompt refinements based on usage patterns
